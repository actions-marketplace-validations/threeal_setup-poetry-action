The Setup Poetry Action is a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) designed to streamline the setup of [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), a powerful dependency and packaging manager for [Python](https://www.python.org/) projects. This action allows you to easily configure and use a specific version of Poetry within your GitHub Actions workflow, enabling you to build and test your Python project seamlessly.
